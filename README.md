# Redux Toolkit Tutorial

This project was created as part of a series to help beginners in Redux Toolkit to further the understanding of the concepts and the usage of Redux Toolkit.

> **Note**: If you are using Node 17, this project may not start correctly due to a known issue with Webpack and Node's OpenSSL changes, which causes an error message containing `ERR_OSSL_EVP_UNSUPPORTED`.  
> You can work around this by setting a `NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider` environment variable before starting the dev server.
